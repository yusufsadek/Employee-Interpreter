# DEPI Final Python Project: Company Employee Data Management System 
## introduction 

       Python-Based Application designed to organize, order, and allow ease of use of Company Employee data for efficiency in gathering simple insights in an optimized, scalable manner.
    I plan to update this from time to time to practice some oop considerations and high-level logic fundamentals, as this has been quite fun to try and learn about.

 ### Functionality
 -  User-Friendly Command-Line Interface. 
 -  Viewing list of all employees, including personal and professional data attached to each employee.
 -  Ability to edit (Add, Remove, Modify) the Viewing list, given to users with the required access.
 -  Protected/Encapsulated data search through employee list using unique enumerated index access.
 -  Import/Export of Viewing list data for broadcast and scale. (as CSV) 
 -  Authentification of input data to ensure veracity.
 -  First-Execute Landing and Tutorial *(To be Added)*
 -  Exisiting email Verification *(To be Added)*
## Design and Modeling
  The Design pattern and refactor of this project is equivalent of a Model-View Controller (MVC), with a total of Three classes, namely: 1) The interperter Class 2) The Employees class 3) The Managing class.
